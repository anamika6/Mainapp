<h3><b>GATE Expected Cutoff Marks:</b></h3>
<p>

    The cut off marks will be declared differently by each participating institute and it will also
    be
    distinct for different courses. Various public and private sector undertakings that consider
    GATE
    scores for employment purposes will also declared their own cut off marks. The cut off marks
    will be
    published in the official website.
</p>
<h3><b>Important Points related to GATE 2017 Cutoff Marks:</b></h3>
<p>
    1. For graduate aptitude test in engineering, the cut off marks will be decided by a committee
    constituted by IIT council.
    2. The applicants who will fulfill the requirements of cut off marks of a particular
    institute/course will be termed eligible to take part in admission process further.
    3. There are various factors that will be considered in deciding cut off marks for GATE. Some of
    the main factors are as follows-
     of applicants registered for GATE .
     of applicants appeared for examination.
     of participating institute.
     of vacancies for particular course.
     Capacity of intake of each institute.
     Relative performance level of the applicants.
     Rules related to reservation of the various participating institute.
     Admission and cut off trends of the previous year.
    4. The 2 components will be involved in cut of GATE 2017, Cut off marks and cut off rank. The
    cut off rank is nothing but the rank corresponding to the GATE 2017 cut off scores.
    5. A merit list will be prepared based on cut off marks for short listing applicants for
    counseling and admission.

<h2><b>GATE Paper Pattern:</b></h2>
<p>The GATE examination for the papers AE, AG, CE, CS, EC, EE, ME will be conducted ONLINE using
    computers .In all the papers, there will be a total of 65 questions carrying 100 marks, out of
    which 10 questions carrying a total of 15 marks are in General Aptitude (GA).</p>
<p>In the papers bearing the codes AE, CE, CS, EC, EE, , ME the Engineering Mathematics will carry
    around 15% of the total marks, the General Aptitude section will carry 15% of the total marks
    and the remaining percentage of the total marks is devoted to the subject of the paper.</p>
<h4><b>The questions in a paper may be designed to test the following abilities:</b></h4>
<p>(i) Recall: These are based on facts, principles, formulae or laws of the discipline of the
    paper. The candidate is expected to be able to obtain the answer either from his/her memory of
    the subject or at most from a one-line computation.
    Example
    Q. During machining maximum heat is produced
    (A) in flank face
    (B) in rake face
    (C) in shear zone
    (D) due to friction between chip and tool
</p>
<p>(ii) Comprehension: These questions will test the candidate’s understanding of the basics of
    his/her field, by requiring him/her to draw simple conclusions from fundamental ideas.
    Example:
    Q. A DC motor requires a starter in order to
    (A) develop a starting torque
    (B) compensate for auxiliary field ampere turns
    (C) limit armature current at starting
    (D) provide regenerative braking
</p>
<p>
    (iii) Application: In these questions, the candidate is expected to apply his/her knowledge
    either through computation or by logical reasoning.
    Example:
    Q.The sequent depth ratio of a hydraulic jump in a rectangular channel is 16.48. The Froude
    number at the beginning of the jump is:
    (A) 5.0
    (B) 8.0
    (C) 10.0
    (D) 12.0
    Examples of each of this design is given in the types of questions above.
    The questions based on the above logics may be a mix of single standalone statement/phrase/data
    type questions, combination of option codes type questions or match items type questions.

</p>
<p>(iv) Analysis and Synthesis: In these questions, the candidate is presented with data, diagrams,
    images etc. that require analysis before a question can be answered. A Synthesis question might
    require the candidate to compare two or more pieces of information. Questions in this category
    ,could, for example, involve candidates in recognising unstated assumptions, or separating
    useful
    information from irrelevant information.

</p>
<h2><b>GATE Paper Structure:</b></h2>
<h3><b>GATE would contain questions of two different types in various papers:</b></h3>
<p>
    (i) Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ) carrying 1 or 2 marks each in all papers and sections. These
    questions are objective in nature, and each will have a choice of four answers, out of which the
    candidate has to mark the correct answer(s).
</p>
<p>
    (ii) Numerical Answer Questions of 1 or 2 marks each in all papers and sections. For these
    questions the answer is a real number, to be entered by the candidate using the virtual keypad.
    No choices will be shown for this type of questions.
</p>
<h3><b>General Aptitude Questions:</b></h3>
<p>

    All the papers will contain few questions that test the General Aptitude (Language and
    Analytical
    Skills), apart from the core subject of the paper.
</p>
<h2><b>Marking Scheme:</b></h2>
<p>

    For a wrong answer chosen for the multiple choice questions, there would be negative marking.
    For
    1-mark multiple choice questions, 1/3 mark will be deducted for a wrong answer. Likewise, for
    2-mark
    multiple choice questions, 2/3 mark will be deducted for a wrong answer. However, there is no
    negative marking for a wrong answer in numerical answer type questions.

</p>
<p>GATE will be conducted in the subjects (also referred to as “papers”) shown in Table below
    Candidates must familiarize with the paper code for the paper of their choice, as this knowledge
    will be required at the time of application form submission and appearing for the examination. A
    candidate is allowed to appear in ONLY ONE paper.</p>
<p>Since a candidate is allowed to appear in ONLY ONE of the 22 papers for which GATE examination is
    being held, the candidate has to make the choice of the paper he/she wishes to write carefully.
    Table below gives the list of GATE papers and paper codes for GATE .</p>
<p>The candidate is expected to appear in a paper appropriate to the discipline of his/her
    qualifying degree. However, the candidate is, free to choose any paper according to his/her
    admission plan, keeping in mind the eligibility criteria of the institutions in which he/she
    wishes to seek admission. </p>

<h2>GATE Paper Duration And Examination Type:</h2>
<p>

    The GATE examination consists of a single paper of 3-hour duration that contains 65 questions
    carrying a maximum of 100 marks. The question paper will consist of both multiple choice
    questions
    (MCQ) and numerical answer type questions.
</p>
<p>The examination for all the papers will be carried out in an ONLINE Computer Based Test (CBT)
    mode where the candidates will be shown the questions in a random sequence on a computer screen.
    The candidates are required to either select the answer (for MCQ type) or enter the answer for
    numerical answer type question using a mouse on a virtual keyboard (keyboard of the computer
    will be disabled). Candidates will be provided with blank paper sheets for rough work and these
    have to be returned back after the examination. At the end of the 3-hour window, the computer
    will automatically close the screen from further actions.
